- Binary Tree means a tree which will have only two node at max
- It may have only one on any side of null on the both side
- the value of the left node will always smaller than the root node 
- the value of the right node will always greater than the root node
- (Note) in the BST the duplicate values wont be present if they does it's a different circumstance
