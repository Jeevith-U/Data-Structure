- Binary Tree means a tree which will have only two node at max
- It may have only one on any side of null on the both side
- the value of the left node will always smaller than the root node 
- the value of the right node will always greater than the root node
- (Note) in the BST the duplicate values wont be present if they does it's a different circumstance 
   that need to be consider separately
- if you do in order traversal on BST You will always get a sorted array(Left, NOde, Right)
- worst time complexity for searching is O(Height) or O(logn)

--- There are 5 different types of Binary Tree
  - Full Binary Tree -> it has 0 or 2 children
  - Complete Binary tree -> all the node should have two children except leaf node or u can have child as left as possible
  - perfect binary tree -> all the leaf are at same level
  - Balanced binary tree -> the height f the tree should be mlog n n -> nodes  ex. 8 node log(8) -> 3 Height should be 3
  - degenerate tree -> tree moving in one particular direction ex liinked List
