-- Map is An interface and HashTable is a class
 - HashTable introduced in v1 but hashmap was introduced in v1.2
 - HashTable is thread safe but hashmap is not thread safe
 - HashTable is slow but hashmap fast

-- Entry is an Interface present inside map
 - entrySet() will convert individual entry(key value pair) to one entry

-- Hashing
 - collision --> After Hashing if two key gets same hash value we collision
 - If input is a Number n you can do n % m
 - If input is a string what we can do is travers over the string take the ASCII Value of it power it by a number and add them % m
   this is called as " Weighted Sum "
 - If object is there we can do the same for Any one of the attribute

-- Hash Table
 - Hash Table is Just A Array of Node
 - Node class has key, value, Node, hash
 - if you have only one node in an Array then the search complexity is O(1) or else it will be O( 1 + length of Node )
